- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
At first it was a bit confusing, but after I thought it through logically on how a train would work it made more sense. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I would tell someone that they should break down the programming by thinking of the train as real individual parts. This is because when I was working on the code with my group we would often get confused because we were thinking about the code as one huge train instead of its parts. 

What did not work was that we were overthinking the code and overcomplicated the idea of a train, but after we fixed our perception everything worked out smoothly.
